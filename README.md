# Data puller

Small application I wrote to pull various data from both US and Argentina financial markets.

Written in Scala just for fun

## Running

The app was built with `Scala 3.3.3` and `sbt 1.10.2`. If you have those two set up and running, just run:

```sbt run```

and that should do.

Conveniently, the app is Dockerized so it can be deployed on my on-premise Kubernetes cluster
